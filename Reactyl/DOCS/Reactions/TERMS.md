## Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)

The **enthalpy of formation** (ΔHf) is the change in enthalpy that occurs when one mole of a compound is created from its constituent elements in their most stable states under standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm). The standard enthalpy of formation for any element in its most stable form is zero.

### Key Aspects

- **Definition**: It is the energy required to form one mole of a compound from its elements
- **Standard conditions**: Typically measured at 25°C and 1 atm pressure
- **Zero value**: Elements in their standard states, such as O₂(g) or C(s, graphite), have a standard enthalpy of formation equal to zero
- **Symbol**: The symbol is ΔHf° (standard enthalpy of formation), where the "°" indicates standard conditions
- **Sign convention**: 
  - A negative ΔHf means the formation reaction releases energy (exothermic)
  - A positive ΔHf means the formation reaction absorbs energy (endothermic)

### Example

The standard enthalpy of formation for carbon dioxide gas (CO₂) is -393.5 kJ/mol, representing the energy change for the reaction:

C(s, graphite) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)

### Calculating Reaction Enthalpy

Use the following formula, where n and m are the stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced chemical equation:

**ΔHrxn = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣmΔHf(reactants)**

The sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products is subtracted from the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

## Activation Energy (Ea)

The **activation energy** is the minimum energy required for a chemical reaction to occur. It represents the energy barrier that reactants must overcome to form products.

### Key Aspects
- **Definition**: The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state
- **Symbol**: Ea
- **Effect on reaction rate**: Higher activation energy means slower reaction rate
- **Temperature dependence**: Increasing temperature provides more molecules with sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier

## Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG)

**Gibbs free energy** is a thermodynamic quantity that combines enthalpy and entropy to predict the spontaneity of a reaction.

### Key Aspects
- **Definition**: G = H - TS (where H is enthalpy, T is temperature, and S is entropy)
- **Spontaneity**: 
  - ΔG < 0: Spontaneous reaction
  - ΔG > 0: Non-spontaneous reaction
  - ΔG = 0: Reaction at equilibrium
- **Standard conditions**: ΔG° refers to standard conditions (1 atm, 25°C)

## Entropy (S)

**Entropy** is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system.

### Key Aspects
- **Definition**: A thermodynamic property that quantifies the number of microscopic arrangements of a system
- **Units**: J/(mol·K)
- **Trends**: 
  - Gases have higher entropy than liquids
  - Liquids have higher entropy than solids
  - More complex molecules have higher entropy
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: The entropy of the universe always increases in spontaneous processes

## Hess's Law

**Hess's Law** states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps in the reaction.

### Key Aspects
- **Definition**: The enthalpy change of a reaction is independent of the pathway taken
- **Application**: Allows calculation of enthalpy changes for reactions that are difficult to measure directly
- **Mathematical expression**: ΔHtotal = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3 + ...

## Chemical Equilibrium

**Chemical equilibrium** is a state in a reversible reaction where the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, resulting in constant concentrations of reactants and products.

### Key Aspects
- **Dynamic equilibrium**: Both forward and reverse reactions continue, but at equal rates
- **Equilibrium constant (K)**: A numerical value expressing the ratio of product to reactant concentrations at equilibrium
- **Le Chatelier's Principle**: If a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it will shift to counteract the disturbance

## Reaction Rate and Kinetics

### Rate Law
The **rate law** is an equation that relates the rate of a chemical reaction to the concentration of its reactants.

**Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n**

Where:
- k = rate constant
- [A], [B] = concentrations of reactants
- m, n = reaction orders

### Arrhenius Equation
The **Arrhenius equation** describes the temperature dependence of reaction rates:

**k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)**

Where:
- k = rate constant
- A = pre-exponential factor
- Ea = activation energy
- R = gas constant
- T = temperature

## Bond Enthalpy

**Bond enthalpy** is the energy required to break one mole of a particular type of bond in a gaseous molecule.

### Key Aspects
- **Definition**: Average energy required to break a specific type of bond
- **Units**: kJ/mol
- **Application**: Used to estimate reaction enthalpies
- **Bond strength**: Higher bond enthalpy = stronger bond

## Catalysts

A **catalyst** is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process.

### Key Aspects
- **Mechanism**: Works by lowering the activation energy
- **Types**: Homogeneous (same phase) and heterogeneous (different phase)
- **Enzymes**: Biological catalysts that are highly specific
- **Effect**: Speeds up both forward and reverse reactions equally

## Thermodynamic Laws

### First Law of Thermodynamics
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.

### Second Law of Thermodynamics
The entropy of the universe always increases in spontaneous processes.

### Third Law of Thermodynamics
The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is zero.

## Standard States and Conditions

### Standard State
The **standard state** is the physical state of a substance under standard conditions (1 atm pressure and 25°C).

### Standard Conditions
- Temperature: 25°C (298 K)
- Pressure: 1 atm
- Concentration: 1 M (for solutions)

## Calorimetry

**Calorimetry** is the measurement of heat changes in physical and chemical processes.

### Key Aspects
- **Calorimeter**: Instrument used to measure heat changes
- **Heat capacity**: Amount of heat required to raise temperature by 1°C
- **Specific heat capacity**: Heat capacity per gram of substance
- **Applications**: Determining reaction enthalpies and heat capacities

The measure of the individual potential of a reversible electrode at standard state.

### Nernst Equation
