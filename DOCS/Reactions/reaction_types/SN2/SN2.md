SN2 reactions result in Walden inversion because the nucleophile attacks the substrate from the side opposite the leaving group, leading to the inversion of all three groups attached to the stereogenic center. This is often visualized as an umbrella flipping inside out in the wind, converting the reactant's configuration into its enantiomer.  
Mechanism of Walden Inversion in SN2 Reactions

    Backside Attack:
    In an SN2 reaction, the nucleophile (incoming group) attacks the electrophilic carbon atom from the side that is opposite to where the leaving group is located. 

Transition State:
During this process, the central carbon atom temporarily forms a pentavalent transition state with both the incoming nucleophile and the leaving group partially bonded to it. 
Stereochemical Flip:
The leaving group then departs, and the nucleophile forms a complete bond. The other three groups attached to the carbon atom are "pushed" to the opposite side, flipping their configuration. 
Enantiomeric Product:
This process results in a product that is the enantiomer of the starting material, meaning it has the opposite stereochemical configuration. 

Analogy: The Flipped Umbrella
A common analogy for Walden inversion is an umbrella flipping inside out in a strong wind. 

    Reactant: The umbrella, before the wind hits, is in its original, outward-facing position.
    Transition State: As the wind (nucleophile) blows, the umbrella begins to flip inside out.
    Product: The final, inverted umbrella is the product, with its "canopy" now facing the opposite direction.
